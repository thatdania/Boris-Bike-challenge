# Boris Bike challenge 

This is a program that emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure
of a city cycle network. Given we are constantly switching pairs and who's project 
to work on, this was a work in progress stage (the starting stage) or creating 
a docking station system for Boris Bikes. It was more of a learning experience with 
Ruby & testing than a finished product. ðŸš²
